### 🩺 About Me

After 15+ years in ERs, recovery rooms, drug & alcohol detox, and other high-acuity settings, I’ve spent enough time decoding physiology under pressure. I've decided to teach myself how to decode those same patterns in:

- sequences  
- structures  
- machine learning models  
- high-dimensional biological chaos  

This GitHub is my raw logbook of experiments, messy notebooks, broken scripts, and the occasional “Eureka” moment.

<strong>My strength is translating lived clinical insight into computational questions worth solving.</strong>  
<strong>Actively seeking feedback, correction, and guidance from people who have walked this path.</strong>

## 🔬 Current Focus  
(Insights and advice from others in the field besides ChatGPT gladly welcomed!)

- 🧠 Protein structure prediction & analysis (AlphaFold, PyMOL, RCSB PDB)  
- 🧬 Sequence analysis & variant pathogenicity modeling  
- 🤖 Deep learning on biological sequences & 3D structures  
- 🛠 Reproducible Python pipelines for bioinformatics  
- 💜 I’m very interested in applying computational methods to real clinical problems that improve care delivery.

## 🧠 Active Learning Path

- Python for bioinformatics (Biopython, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib)  
- Rosalind problem sets (daily brain gains)  
- Genomic Data Science Specialization – Johns Hopkins  
- Practical Deep Learning for Coders – fast.ai  
- Structural bioinformatics & molecular visualization  

---

## 🧪 Projects (in progress)

- Clinically-informed variant pathogenicity classifier  
- AlphaFold pocket & binding-site analysis  
- RNA-seq differential expression pipelines  
- Interactive protein domain/motif visualization tools  
- A growing constellation of annotated Jupyter notebooks

  <strong>First completed project:</strong> I used AI-assisted Python to streamline a complex alcohol detox medication schedule for Librium and built a working tool for my co-workers and I to use:<br>
