Alanine (A, Ala)
 

EL5 

Alanine is the “basic Lego block.”

It’s tiny, calm, and easy to work with, like the kid in class who never causes trouble and fills in any empty spot.

BIS Deep Dive

- Size: Small
- Polarity: Nonpolar
- Structural personality:  
    

- Often used in “alanine scanning” to test importance of residues
- Supports α-helices by being small and non-bulky
- Flexible but not floppy like glycine

-   
    

  

  

  

Why Mutations Matter

  

  

- A → V adds bulk (can stress tight spaces)
- A → P breaks helices
- A → G adds too much flexibility
